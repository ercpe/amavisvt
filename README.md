`amavisvt` is a daemon to include [Virustotal](https://virustotal.com) as an amavisd-new virus scanner by using the Virustotal Public API.

`amavisvt` uses memcached to reduce the number of calls to the API. While it's possible to run amavisvt without memached, it's strongly advised to do so.
Even with memcached in place, you might hit Virustotals API limit pretty fast and `amavisvt` will stop detecting an new threats.
If you hit Virustotal's API limit regularly, you might want to change the API endpoint url to an alternative one (see below), which acts as a proxy and has a much higher limit.    

`amavisvt` uses the SHA256 hash of mimeparts to fetch file scan reports from Virustotal.
`amavisvt` **does not** send any content to virustotal unless you have the filename pattern detection feature enabled (see `amavisvt_example.cfg` for details).
To reduce the number of requests to VT even further, `amavisvt` only asks for reports for parts whose mime type (identified by libmagic) starts with `application/`, `image/` or are typical scripts (perl, python, shell).

In future versions, `amavisvt` may integrate configurable filter for the mime types and/or file extensions.

# Installation

## Gentoo

Add the [last hope overlay](https://ercpe.de/projects/last-hope-gentoo-portage-overlay) and emerge amavisvt:

    layman -a last-hope
    emerge app-antivirus/amavisvt -av

## Ubuntu 16.04 (and onward)

Download and unzip the source into a directory of choice (like `/usr/local/src`). Change to the extracted files and run:

```
apt install python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install
```

This should install the plugin into `/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/amavisvt-0.5.3-py3.5.egg/amavisvt`.
Copy `amavisvt_example.cfg` to `/etc/amavisvt.cfg` and edit it to suit your needs. Most default will be fine, but you
**must** change the `api-key` value.

To make a test run you can launch:

```
python3 /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/amavisvt-0.5.3-py3.5.egg/amavisvt/amavisvtd.py
```

If it works you can create a systemd service by copying [`amavis-vtd.service`](etc/amavis-vtd.service) to `/etc/systemd/system` and running:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable amavis-vtd
systemctl start amavis-vtd
```

Tested with Python 3.5.2.

# Configuration

First, create an account on virustotal.com to obtain your API key. After registration, you can find it under "My API key"

`amavisvt` ships with an [example config file](https://code.not-your-server.de/amavisvt.git/blob/master/amavisvt_example.cfg). Place it in one of the following locations: `/etc/amavisvt.cfg`, `~/amavisvt.cfg` or `./amavisvt.cfg` and adjust it to your needs.

Please note, the location of memcached isn't configurable at the moment. The instance has to run on `127.0.0.1:11211` and must accept connections from localhost.

As a last step, configure amavisd-new by adding the following snippet to either `@av_scanners` or `@av_scanners_backup`. Starting with 0.4 AmavisVT uses a daemon:

    ['AmavisVTd',
        \&ask_daemon, ["CONTSCAN {}\n", "/run/amavisvtd.sock"],
        undef,
        qr/(?:Detected as) (.*)/m,
        qr/(?:Detected as) (.*)/m],
